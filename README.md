🚀 Overview
This project is a Grammar Checker that helps users identify and correct grammatical errors in written text. It leverages the Gramformer library, a state-of-the-art NLP model designed for grammar correction.

To provide an intuitive and easy-to-use experience, the project integrates Gradio, allowing users to access the grammar correction tool through a simple web-based interface.
